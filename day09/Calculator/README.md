# Calculator

## File

* [`calculator-starter`](Unsolved/calculator.html)

## Instructions

* Create the JavaScript logic necessary to add functionality to the Calculator.

* Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

* You should be making use of the existing buttons.

* You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

* You should have fun and push yourselves! This is a challenge activity—which means, if you get it done, you are a King of Javascript. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.
